# Manage Mockify Projects
![gatewatch](https://github.com/ARAldhafeeri/mockify-docs/blob/main/imgs/projectpage.png?raw=true)

You manage Mockify projects on the projects page, where you may add, modify, and remove projects. It should be noted that an API key is generated for use on project-related resources at the time of project creation. It is mandatory to include the `x-api-key header with every request made to any project endpoint. The project page table contains the API key, which you can copy. All resources have to be associated with a project; this is how access control is handled by mockify.io. Keep your access key private and secure; Mockify.io wants to speed up your development, not jeopardize the infrastructure on which your services are hosted.
