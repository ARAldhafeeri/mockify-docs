# Manage Mockify Projects

The projects page is for managing Mockify projects, where you can create, edit, and delete projects. Note that with every project creation, an API key is generated to be used on resources linked to the project. For every request to any project resource, the `x-api-key` header must be included. You can copy the API key from the project page table.

## Create Project

1. Click on the projects tab.
2. Click on create project.
3. Fill in the form.
4. Click on create project.

## Edit Project

1. Click on the projects tab.
2. Click on edit project.
3. Fill in the form.
4. Click on update project.

## Delete Project

1. Click on the projects tab.

3. Click yes on the confirmation message.
4. Project is deleted.

**Note:** Currently, upon deletion of a project, resources will be hidden from the admin portal but not deleted. Once we get enough feedback, we will handle this in a different way.
