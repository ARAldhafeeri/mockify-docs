# Manage Mockify Users

The users page is for managing Mockify admin portal users, and mock users for mock API endpoints and projects. There are 3 default types of users:

1. Super Admin
2. Admin
3. User

Super Admin is the main admin of the platform and can perform all actions, currently there is only one per deployment for security reasons. Admins can do everything except managing users. Users can only manage their own projects. To manage users, you need to be a Super Admin.
