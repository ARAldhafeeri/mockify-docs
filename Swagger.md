# Swagger page
mockify auto-generate swagger docs for each resource, you can access it by clicking on the swagger from navigation bar.

The page is filtered by resource Name, once clicked on resource swagger ui appears. And clicking on show swagger button will show the swagger json.

How mockify generate swagger docs?
- mockify generate swagger docs based on the resource defination, resource edge functions, and resource endpoints.
- User do not need to do anything, mockify will generate swagger docs for each resource automatically.

The generation of swagger docs is cached, generated client-side, so it will not affect the performance of the application.
